All around the world but mostly underground there are many clumps of colorful crystal clusters.

There are 6 crystal types, one for each primal aspect. These give off a small glow and when harvested they will drop primal vis crystals. Researching reveals that these crystals grow in places where vis is high and will be used to replenish the aura should it drop.
