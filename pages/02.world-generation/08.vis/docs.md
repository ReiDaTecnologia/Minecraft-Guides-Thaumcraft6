Vis (pronounced “vee”) is magical energy ambient in the environment. Every chunk has some level of vis but some have more than others. As you use spells and foci (more on these can be found in their sections) the vis in the chunk will go down. Vis will slowly build up again in chunks where it is missing and balance itself with adjacent chunks.
