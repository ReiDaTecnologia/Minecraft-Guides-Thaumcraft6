Amber bearing stone and Cinnabar ore can be found deep underground or in mountains. Breaking Amber bearing stone gives you amber, and rarely, a preserved curiosity. Otherwise using a pickaxe with silk-touch gives you the Amber bearing stone that smelts into amber which is also used in many crafting recipes. Cinnabar ore smelts into quicksilver which is also used in many crafting recipes.
