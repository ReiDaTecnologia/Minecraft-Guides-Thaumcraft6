As long as you have closed a few rifts, scanned the seeds and gathered some Eldritch research then you should be able to complete this almost instantly.

After completing this you will be able to use the void seeds to make Void Ingots (Scan these), Void Tools, Weapons, Armor and Void Metal Blocks. These tools, weapons and armor do have warping 1 (you might go insane) but they do have the amazing property of being able to repair themselves.

After Examining the metal you should also jump into Golemancy, you should be able to make Void metal Golems who can self heal.
