This is the 6th iteration of Thaumcraft from Azanor. The Thaumcraft mods for Minecraft have been a favourite in the modding scene, and Thaumcraft 6 is still one of the most interesting and entertaining magic mods.

"Thaumaturgy... which giveth certain order to make strange works, of the sense to be perceived and of men greatly to be wondered at." - Mathematical Preface to Euclid's Elements (1570), John Dee.

Thaumaturgy is the capability of a magician to work miracles. A practitioner of Thaumaturgy is a “Thaumaturge”, “Thaumaturgist” or miracle worker.

Thaumcraft 6 is all about drawing magic from physical objects in the form of Essentia and from the environment in the form of Vis and reshaping it to perform miracles.
