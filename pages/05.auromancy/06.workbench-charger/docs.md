You might need to do a little more research for this, but once you have completed the quest, you can craft the Workbench Charger: (This requires 200 vis to craft. You may need to find a chunk with more vis, such as a Magical Forest).

Placing the Charger on top of a workbench will increase the amount of usable Vis in the Workbench by draining it from nearby chunks (in the 8 chunks directly adjacent):

You can also set one top of your Focal Manipulator.
