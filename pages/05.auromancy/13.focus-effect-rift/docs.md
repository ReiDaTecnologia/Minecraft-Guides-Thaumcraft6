Adding this effect will create a “Rift.” Think of this as a hole that you can walk through. For example, why use a door when you can make a Rift and walk right through the wall, or fire it at the feet of your enemies and watch them fall to their death.

You can also set the duration and how deep the rift is:

Just remember that unlocking this will give you a little bit of warp.
