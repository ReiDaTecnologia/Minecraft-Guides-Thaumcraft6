You need to have two items on you with the Silk Touch and the Fortune enchants on them to be able to complete this research.

>>>>This also consumes said enchanted items. Be careful not to complete the research with any important enchanted tools/weapons in your inventory.

Applying this to an Advanced Focus (doing this with a Blank Lesser Focus would be pointless) will let you (with touch) fire at a block and break it (with the fortune or silk touch). This does take a little time to recharge, but it's much quicker than mining and only costs a little Vis, so no need for repairs.
