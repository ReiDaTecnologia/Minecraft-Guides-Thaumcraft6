This stage should be no issue if you have scanned a snow golem. Completing this will give you more options when configuring your Foci. Up to now you have only had fire, but with this completed you unlock three more elements for use:

![](elemental%20effects.jpg)

* **Air**
	* Will knock things back and cause a small amount of damage.
* **Earth**
	* Will break blocks and cause a large amount of damage.
* **Frost**
	* Slow 3 effect on mobs and does medium damage.


With Earth and Air you can only set the power (setting the power to low will let you spam this ability more).
