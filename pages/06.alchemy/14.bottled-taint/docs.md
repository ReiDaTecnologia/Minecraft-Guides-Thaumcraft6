This is another stage that will give you a little bit of warp, but for now it's nothing to worry about. A Bottle of Taint is basically Taint in a Bottle. Throwing a bottle on the ground (DO NOT DO THIS NEAR YOUR BASE, find a far-away open area.) will slowly cause liquid taint to spread. Once it disappears, it leaves behind Fibrous Taint, thus causing taint to take over the area. This taint will continue to spread. This can be very useful for obtaining Vitium if all the taint-related objects you have are from the Giant Taint Seedâ€™s doings. Be sure to make an area cut off with other land with water to avoid unwanted spreading to other areas.
