More research is needed for this (keep using the Crucible Bonus). When you complete this stage you will be affected by Warp.

Liquid Death does what its says on the tin. It will damage anything (hostile or not), and when something is killed by Liquid Death, it will drop Essentia Crystals. Great for using in mob farms! Just don't step in it.
