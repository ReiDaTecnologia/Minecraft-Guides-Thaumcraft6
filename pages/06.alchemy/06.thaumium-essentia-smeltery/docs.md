Now that you can make Thaumium Plates, you can upgrade the Smeltery. The current Smeltery is not very efficient (it loses some of the Essentia when it breaks down items). Do a bit more research and also make three Thaumium ingots in order to make a plate:

Once crafted, the Thaumium Essentia Smeltery should replace your regular Essentia Smeltery. This new smeltery is 90% efficient (unlike the last which was only 80%).and also twice as fast. (make sure you scan it):
