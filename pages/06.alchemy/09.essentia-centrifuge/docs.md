There is a way to break down compound Essentia (Essentia that is made up of more than one aspect). This is useful when you have a lot of items with compound Essentia and you need the Essentia that it is made out of. For example, breaking down Alkimia to get Aqua and Praecantatio.

The Essentia Centrifuge needs to have Essentia pumped into the bottom of it. Once it breaks down the Essentia you need to extract it from the top. It will break down the Essentia into only one of the 2 Essentia that was initially broken down.

The above example is not the best setup for the Essentia Centrifuge but itâ€™s a very simple way of understanding it.
