Research does take time and can be very tedious, there are items that can be found that when used will give you a little bit of research:

* Crimson Rights
	* These drop of cultists but first need to be used in research before you can right click these.
		* These can be farmed if you capture a portal in a Soul Vial From EnderIO
* Preserved Curiosity
	* If you have Quarries going then you will find these in your system, they have a small chance from dropping from Amber ore
* Pech Wand/Illuminating Curiosity
	* These can be traded very rarely from Pech (mages have the wands), gold would be your best resource to trade.
		* If you see a Pech with a wand in hand kill it as it will drop the wand
