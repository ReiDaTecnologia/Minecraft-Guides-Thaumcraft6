This next section is an easy section to complete but has more than one part. Once you have unlocked it, you will need to travel to the deepest part of your world (Around Y level 10) and the highest part (above Y 100).

Once this part is completed you will then be asked to craft two more items (Vis Resonator and Caster's Gauntlet) in your Workbench. The recipes can be found in the Thaumonomicon:

The Vis Resonator recipe is shapeless

If you don't have enough Vis to craft these items youâ€™ll have to move the Workbench to another chunk or let it recharge.

Completing this section will give you access to a new Tab: Auromancy (this will be covered later).
