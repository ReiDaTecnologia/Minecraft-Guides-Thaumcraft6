Before getting into Thaumcraft you will need to have a few things in place:

* Explored the world
* Have a base of operations
* Bookshelf
* Cauldron
* Glass
* Healthy Supply of:
* Paper/Sugar Canes
* Ink
* Collected a few crystals 
	* Collect as many as you can and try and find all 6 different types. A stack of each one is great.

These are the main things you will need to get started. The deeper you dive into Thaumcraft, the more materials you will require.
