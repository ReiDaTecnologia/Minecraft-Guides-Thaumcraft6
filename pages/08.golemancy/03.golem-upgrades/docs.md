Crafting a Simple Golem with no modifiers is a great way to learn how they work and which Golem to use for what task. In most examples, this guide will use wooden Golems, unless otherwise stated. 

You can hit your golems (please donâ€™t do this), and when they die they will drop a few materials (such as wood or any other materials they are made from). There is an easier way to pick these little guys up, by sneak-right-clicking on the Golem.
