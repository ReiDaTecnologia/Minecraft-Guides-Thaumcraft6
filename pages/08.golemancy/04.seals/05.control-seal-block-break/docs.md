This Seal will command Golems to break any blocks in the highlighted area. The hardness of the blocks will determine how quickly blocks are broken. You can filter what kind of blocks should be broken.

Due to the nature of Golems this Seal would not be great for mining.

**Requirements:**

* Required - Breaker
* Forbidden - None
