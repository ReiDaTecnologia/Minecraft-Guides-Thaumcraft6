When this Seal is put onto a container, Golems will put items into that inventory. If placed on a block that doesnâ€™t have an inventory items will be dropped at that location.

You can configure how many items should be put into the inventory and you can filter items that should or should not be put into the inventory.

**Requirements:**

* Forbidden - Clumsy
