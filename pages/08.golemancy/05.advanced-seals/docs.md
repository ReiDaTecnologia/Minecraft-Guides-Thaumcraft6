* Area
	* You can now pick the Up/Down height of the Seal.
* Filter
	* You can now filter 9 specific items.
* Options
	* Use meta, NBT, Ore dictionary and same modes as filters for items.

There are other options in other Seals, so the above options may change/differ depending on the Seal. Advanced Seals act the same as normal Seals, but with more options and more limitations to which Golems can use them.
