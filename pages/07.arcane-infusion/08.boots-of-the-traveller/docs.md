After doing lots of running, walking, swimming and jumping, you should be able to unlock this stage. These boots allow you to run, swim and walk faster, and will let you jump higher. These boots need to be charged first, and will need to be recharged as they are used, so make sure you have a Amulet of Vis equipped.
