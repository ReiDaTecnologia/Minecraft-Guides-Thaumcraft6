Unlocking this will unlock two new blocks:

* Barrier Stone
	* These prevent mobs from crossing them. They will let players cross, but any other mobs or creatures will not be able to pass. They also prevent Golems from crossing. These can be disabled with redstone. Its best to put these down in lines that are unbroken. They also have colours on top of them when next to a mob:
		* Red - There is a gap in the area.
		* Blue - Turned off with redstone.
		* Purple - Preventing something from passing through.

* Paving Stone of Travel
	* You will run or walk faster while these are under your feet.
