The Fortress Armor Faceplates can be enchanted via the Infusion Altar. These all have very high levels of instability. Each one has its own unique properties:


* **Helm of Revealing**
	* Adds the Goggles of Revealing Effect to the helm. This can be put on alongside other masks.
* **Grinning Devil Faceplate**
	* Reduces the effects of Warp.
* **Angry Ghost Faceplate**
	* When struck in combat, the creature striking you has a chance to suffer the withering effect.
* **Sipping Fiend Faceplate**
	* Adds a lifesteal effect when striking enemies.
