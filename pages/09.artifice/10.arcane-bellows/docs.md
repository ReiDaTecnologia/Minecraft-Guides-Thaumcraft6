These Bellows can be attached to Furnaces and Crucibles to speed them up, but their main purpose is to speed up the Infernal Furnace. You can attach up to four to the Infernal Furnace and it will decrease the amount of flux generated, increase its speed and increase the chances of getting bonus nuggets and Rare Earth.
