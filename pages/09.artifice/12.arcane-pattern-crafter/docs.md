The Arcane Pattern Crafter will craft 1 item from 1 material. You need to place it on a chest and put a chest above it. Once the chests have been placed, you need to toggle what recipes you would like to have the Pattern Crafter craft. The dial on the bottom of the Crafter can be right clicked and the 3x3 grid above will change. Once you have your recipe, add materials to the top chest and the Pattern Crafter will craft on its own until the top chest is empty:
