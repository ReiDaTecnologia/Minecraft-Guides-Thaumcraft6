When placed down and given a redstone signal, the Arcane Bore will mine out blocks in front of it. You will need to give the Bore a pickaxe in order for it to work. If the pickaxe is enchanted, it will increase the Depth, Speed and Width. A Fortune enchantment can also increase drops. Placing down a chest next to the Bore will auto-deposit items. The Bore will use 1 vis per 4 blocks mined. Pickaxes will last up to 50 times longer in the Bore. You can change the direction the bore faces by left-clicking it with an empty hand from the direction you would like it to mine.
