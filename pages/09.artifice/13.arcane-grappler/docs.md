The Arcane Grappler is a grappling hook powered by Vis (you will need to charge it). Right-click will fire a grapple that will attach to any surface and then pull you towards it. You will gain a little be of speed so be careful not to kill yourself. Sneaking will detach the grappling hook. The Grappling Hook has a 20 block range.
