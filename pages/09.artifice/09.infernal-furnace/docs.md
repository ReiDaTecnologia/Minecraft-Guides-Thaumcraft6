In order to complete this section you will need to go into the Nether. The Infernal Furnace is another multiblock structure you need to use Salis Mundus on. This fuel free furnace will smelt anything you throw into the top of it and it will spit out any nuggets and ingots from the front. You can place a chest in the hole to catch the items, and a brain in a jar nearby to catch the experience.

You have a chance to gain bonus materials such as nuggets and Rare Earth. The furnace will not double your ores unless they are ore clusters. If your throw in items that cannot be smelted they will be destroyed.

When throwing meat into the furnace you have a chance to gaining Meat Nuggets. These, combined with sugar, will make Triple Meat Treat which, when eaten, will give you Regeneration.
